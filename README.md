About Friend.ly Updates
=======================

Friend.ly is a friendly (pun intended) mobile app similar to the popular known social media platform, Snapchat.

**DISCLAIMER:**

Friend.ly is still in development. While MIT App Inventor has provided a starting point, it also imposes some limitations on what we can currently develop. In the near future, all code will be migrated to Python for greater flexibility and performance.

$${\color{red}This \space program \space is \space not \space fully \space mobile-friendly \space yet, \space especially \space on \space iOS \space devices! \space Friend.ly \space will \space become \space mobile \ space friendly \space in \space a \space future \space update.}$$
