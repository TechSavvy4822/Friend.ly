Friend.ly Update Logs
=======================

Friend.ly is a friendly (pun intended) mobile app similar to the popular known social media platform, Snapchat.

**DISCLAIMER:**

Friend.ly is still in development. While MIT App Inventor has provided a starting point, it also imposes some limitations on what we can currently develop. In the near future, all code will be migrated to Python for greater flexibility and performance.
