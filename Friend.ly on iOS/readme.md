## Friend.ly on iOS
 We’re really excited to share that we're in the process of developing the iOS version of Friend.ly! This update means you can now enjoy the full Friend.ly experience on your iPhone and iPad, with a design that’s smooth, fast, and perfectly tailored for Apple. We focused on making sure the interface is clean, responsive, and easy to use, using Swift and Xcode to get the best performance possible.
